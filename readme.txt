This block is part of the extension package "DASIS" (https://github.com/AndreScherl/DASIS).
It depends on the blocks "case_repository" and "user_preferences", which also are part of DASIS.

DASIS was developed to support students in making their way through hypermedia learning contents. It provides an interactive concept map for navigation and adaptive navigation support.

If you are interested in more information, please have a look into the file "dasis.pdf" within the package.
